### Quest for Glory I EGA (QFG1EGA)
  Game version 1.200
  
  Interpreter version 0.000.629

In rm060, a Meep's disembodied eyes may appear, and there may be priority issues when they pop up.

When Elsa and Barnard are dispelled, the stars may appear on the top-left edge of the screen.

In rm084, the Antwerp keeps bouncing to the lower-left part of the screen, stopped only by the mountainous terrain. Fortunately, it can still be scared off.

In rm094::doit, the fallBridge script is never executed.

The Cheetaur never uses its arms in combat.

Despite all of these issues, I was able to complete the game and export my character for QFG2.
